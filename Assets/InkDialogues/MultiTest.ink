=== main
This is a test for the general ink stuff.

And these are 3 choices:
* [Choice 1]
    -> chosen("Choice1")
* [Choice 2]
    -> chosen("Choice2")
* [Choice 3]
    -> chosen("Choice3")
    
=== chosen(choice)
You picked {choice}!
If you got this far, that means everything works as it should.
But before we go our ways, I'd like to thank today's sponsor

That's all.
